## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

At the time, I started taking a JS course so, with this project, I put in practice all I am learing right now about JavaScript. 
For this project I only use fetch to call the Advice API.
Any feedback is really welcomed :D

### Continued development

I wanna keep practicing because I liked to add some interactivity to the website.

### Useful resources
